# Trackbody - Workout Tracker App

Trackbody is a workout tracker app build using node.js, express, react, and postgres. It is currently designed to track workouts, exercises, and progress for Beachbody workouts. It keeps track of workout streaks, days completed, days remaining, and weight lifted. The idea was to gamify the process of working out and motivate users to workout even when they are not feeling 100% up to it.

## Future features:

- Support for more Beachbody programs
- Support for alternate workouts on a given day (i.e. Some Beachbody schedules have days where users do either Workout A or Rest)
- Support for multiple workouts on a given day (i.e. Some Beachbody schedules have days where users do multiple workouts)
- Support for tracking body metrics like weight and measurements
